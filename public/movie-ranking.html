 <hr />

 <h3>Your Name</h3>
 <p>The way this is animated is quite amazing. It's really a piece of art.</p>

 <h3>Cinema Paradiso</h3>
 <p>The overall movie had so much impact that it would inspire an aspiring filmmaker to start filming.</p>

 <h3>Hugo</h3>
 <p>Really beautiful story. The way the movie was shot was incredible.</p>

 <h3>Grave of fireflies</h3>
 <p>Amazing 2d animated movie by studio ghibli, the story and the work really depicts the outcome
    of the world war and how it affected the families and people of japan</p>
   
 <h3>Kung fu Panda</h3>   
 <p>The animated movie about the panda who has self doubt about himself, slowly learning to master his 
    confidence and giving his all. Best to say super humourous, i was laughing till my stomach hurt. Best laugh i ever had.

 <h3>Numafung</h3>
 <p>It's a movie about the cultural depiction of limbu people in Nepal.
    The movie was released in 2001 but i had the chance to watch it nearly after 17 years if it's release. 
    They have made a re-make of it with the movie name "Jaari" which also has my heart.
    The movie discuss about the limbu culture and their tradition through the seer method of depiction by using two distinctive 
    characters and the plot story.
