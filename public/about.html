<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Sudin Rana Magar. I am an enthusiastic hyper chill person. I am not outgoing person as you may see
   me somewhere sulking and taking the unncessary break from the work. As the topic goes, i love music, doing arts,
    playing video games and hiking. Sports fascinates me, mostly vollyball.</p>

<p>I don't have any graduational certificate nor i have any skills that sort of differentiate me from others
  I take things not that seriously so it sometimes gets me into problem, not sometimes but most of the time.</p>

<p>Having to do things that one doesn't like makes them stronger, well i disgree with that, not completely but 
  to my knowledge i have come to know that people tend to force things that are not supposes to be forced. When
  they do that, people usually loose their patience as well as confidence.

  Generally speaking, most of the time you have to go with the flow, there's this saying "flow like a river"
  and you might think what is this person doing not talking about himself rather giving some motivational junkies,
  well, the truth is that i don't like to study much, i love designing, and creating websites is like designing,so 
  i am taking this path and see how much i can grow in this field.</p>
